The Procrastinator's Timeclock is a simple application designed to help easily-
distracted people remain focused on getting a certain amount of work done per
day while remaining flexible enough to adapt to changes in motivation, mood,
and external stresses.

It does this by working to counter several key contributors to procrastination:

1. You never intend to waste your entire day/week/etc. on distractions.
   Having an easy-to-use timeclock helps you to see how quickly your little
   distractions are adding up.
2. Willpower has nothing to do with will. According to researchers, self-control
   depends on the ability to distract oneself from undesirable influences...
   something the timeclock helps with whenever you check how much time is left.
3. Sometimes, people procrastinate as a way of avoiding "going on the clock".
   The timeclock helps you to get used to the idea that, even if you're just
   trying to finish a book before bedtime, you're always on the clock.

However, as with any solution, discouragement is always a risk. Please keep the
following in mind while using the timeclock:

- Initially, you will probably fall short of your goals. I recommend budgeting
  six hours and expecting to initially average about four hours of productivity
  per day. (This assumes a schedule which allots eight hours including breaks)
- "Work before pleasure" is ideal, but it's much more likely that you'll start
  out spending all your leisure and daily routine time before you start working.
  Don't let this discourage you. Once you get used to having a guaranteed
  minimum amount of leisure time, it'll become easier to motivate yourself to
  work first and relax afterward.
