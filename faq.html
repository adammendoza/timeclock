<dl>
    <dt>I don't want to run a development version. When will you make a release?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>The default branch (master) isn't actually a development version. It's what I refer to as "stabilized dev" and only gets updated when the copy I'm using (the "development" branch) stabilizes.</p>
        <p>However, I will also release proper packages once Timeclock meets my exacting standards for a proper release and I figure out how to reliably and easily build Windows (and possibly MacOS) packages to go along with the source release. (I want to release on all target platforms simultaneously)</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Why is only one developer listed as a user on Ohloh?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>FunnyMan3595 didn't feel like registering an Ohloh account. Don't worry. We both use the timeclock regularly.</p>
